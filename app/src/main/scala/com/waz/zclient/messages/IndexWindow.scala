    * Most of the time our cursor will have only small change (one addition or removal), we don't try to be exact here,
    * RecyclerView expects to receive just one notification anyway, so we will fall back to generic notifyItemRangeChanged
    * in case of more complicated changes, will notify with range encompassing all changes.

    * We also track total count of messages to detect any additions or removals outside of current window.
    * Will report full data set change if deduced changes doen't add up with total count, this is needed to avoid inconsistencies in recycler view.
    *
    * XXX: This doesn't work well when message is moved, it will just update all messages in range of move.
    * We might want to improve that, although we rarely move messages, only in case of race conditions,
    * there is no intended use case for moving of message.
